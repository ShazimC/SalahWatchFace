# SalahWatchFace

This is a watch face made for muslims that includes a display for the next salah start/ending time along with standard displays like time, date, weather, and battery.
This watch face is written in HTML, CSS, and JS as a Tizen App for Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2 which runs the Tizen Operating System.

## To Run
1. Follow this guide to set up Tizen Web for VSCode on your local machine: https://docs.tizen.org/application/vscode-ext/web/
2. Build the project by either right clicking on the project folder in VSCode and pressing "Tizen Web: Build Tizen App" or running the same command via VSCode's command palette.
3. Make sure an emuator or a device is connected and running via the device manager. You'll need to have a samsung certificate installed in order to run directly on a device: https://developer.samsung.com/tizen/Galaxy-Watch/certificate/creating-certificate.html
4. Install the project from the same methods mentioned in step 2.
5. Set the watch face on the emulator or device via settings.

If you're having trouble running the project still, I recommend google and the tizen documentation.
