# SalahWatchFace

This is a watch face made for muslims that includes a display for the next salah start/ending time along with standard displays like time, date, weather, and battery.
This watch face is written in HTML, CSS, and JS as a Tizen App for Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2 which runs the Tizen Operating System. Will upload screenshots soon tm.
